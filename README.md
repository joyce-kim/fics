## Pages

1. Explore: 
	- users can search for food item via search bar
	- each photo contains location and uploader's comment
	- users can go to upload their own photo

2. Upload:
	- users can upload their photo with their own comment

## To Do

1. Set up database/routes/api/controllers(what is this)
2. Figure out how photo data sits in database so we can then figure out how to display this data/photo on Explore page
3. make dummy photo data in db
4. make Upload component such that users can post their photos and comments to the db
5. render photos to explore page
6. make search bar to filter through photos (all photos will show unless "food term" searched; after a search, photos will only show those related to the "food term")
7. clicking a photo will either direct to page about the photo or show another div instead of the photo with location and uploader's comment
8. beautify

## Backlog
1. Ability to comment on photos
